## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```

```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(plotly)

pal <- c("red", "blue", "green")

p <- plot_ly(data = iris, x = ~Sepal.Length, y = ~Petal.Length, color = ~Species, colors = pal)

# Create a shareable link to your chart
# Set up API credentials: https://plot.ly/r/getting-started
chart_link = plotly_POST(p, filename="scatter/color-custom")
chart_link
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
